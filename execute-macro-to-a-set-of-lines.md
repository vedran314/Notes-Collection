# In Vim, how do I apply a macro to a set of lines?


Use the normal command in Ex mode to execute the macro on multiple/all lines:

Execute the macro stored in register a on lines 5 through 10.

```
:5,10norm! @a
```
Execute the macro stored in register a on lines 5 through the end of the file.

```
:5,$norm! @a
```
Execute the macro stored in register a on all lines.

```
:%norm! @a
```
Execute the macro store in register a on all lines matching pattern.

```
:g/pattern/norm! @a
```
To execute the macro on visually selected lines, press V and the j or k until the desired region is selected. Then type :norm! @a and observe the that following input line is shown.

```
:'<,'>norm! @a
```
Enter :help normal in vim to read more.
