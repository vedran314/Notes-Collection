Beginning of line and end of line movements:

The different types of "words"

words - represent a sequence of characters in the 'iskeyword' class.
WORDs - represent a sequence of characters separated by whitespace.

Run :help word and :help WORD

## Forward word movement

We learn to move foward to the next WORD and word both to the beginning of words and the end of words.

>Commands are **w, W, e** and **E**.

## Backward word movement
We learn to move backward to the previous WORD and word both to the beginning of words and the end of words.

>Commands are **b, B, ge and gE.**

## "To the Character" movement 

The great, super great commands:
